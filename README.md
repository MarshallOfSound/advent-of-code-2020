# Advent Of Code 2020

This repository contains my solutions.  Each solution is run through the "run" bootstrapper.

## How to run the code

```bash
# runs the first puzzle in day 1
./run 1/first

# runs the second puzzle in day 3
./run 3/second
```

## Why did you do the weird run thing?

I'm far too lazy to write the "fs.readFile" bit every day, so instead I wasted way more time writing a handy dandy bootstrapping script.

## Your code doesn't work on my machine

Well, um, sorry I guess? I ran this on a macOS machine with node 12
